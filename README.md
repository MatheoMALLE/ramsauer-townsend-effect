# Ramsauer‚ÄìTownsend Effect üöÄ
The aim of this project is to study the **Ramsauer-Townsend quantum phenomenon**, an effect observed during the scattering of low-energy electrons (typically around 1 eV) on atoms of **noble gases** such as **xenon (Xe)**, **krypton (Kr)** or **argon (Ar)**. While classical theory predicts a gradual increase in the effective cross-section with decreasing electron energy, experiments reveal a **deep in the scattering curve**. At precise energies, the electrons seem to pass through the atoms without any significant interaction, as if they were temporarily ‚Äútransparent‚Äù to the incident beam.

This behaviour can only be explained within the framework of **quantum mechanics**, thanks in particular to the **wave packet** and the **phenomena of constructive and destructive interference** in the wave function of the incident electron. The dip observed in the effective cross-section corresponds to a quasi-total destructive interference, analogous to a resonance phenomenon.

## üõ†Ô∏è Roadmap
- modelisation of diffusion by an **effective potential** (square and spherical potential)
- **solve of the Schr√∂dinger equation** in one or more dimensions.
- calculation of the transmission probability and the effective scattering cross-section.
- **computer modelling** (in Python) of the different physical solutions (wave packet).
- visualisation of the results.

## üß∞ Skills required
- theoretical physics
- scientific calcule
- **Python** programming
- educational presentation of results
